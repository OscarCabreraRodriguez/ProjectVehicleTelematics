# ProjectVehicleTelematics

Java Flink project about stream mining. In the src folder you will find 4 classes. VehicleTelematics.java is the main class where we read the stream and apply to it the different exercises. We can find 3 exercises SpeedRadar.java, AverageSpeedControl.java, AccidentReporter.java. In these exercises we apply different operations to the data stream depending on the objective of the exercise. Furthermore, we use windows to control the stream.
